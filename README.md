This simple iOS app is mostly made by me following an official Apple guide

It helped me learn iOS developing, Git and Github

On top of the original version, I added some new features
	1. Allows the user to use camera to save meals
	2. Will not display defualt values
	3. Removed guards that might crash the app
	4. Made the app compatible with iPad
